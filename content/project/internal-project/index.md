title: Estimating the Effectiveness of Private Spending on Species Recovery
---

Abstract: The effectiveness of environmental groups’ expenditures on endangered and threatened species recovery is not well examined in current literature because of the lack of detailed species data and identification challenge. This paper provides the first estimation of the effect of environmental groups’ expenditures on species recovery, using the case of Pacific Northwest salmonids. Leveraging salmonids’ biological features, we regress salmonids population on lagged nonprofit groups’ expenditure to address the endogeneity concerns of nonprofits’ spending with a two-way fixed effects model. Our results show a positive impact of cumulative expenditures on salmon recovery. We also conduct a cost analysis, which shows that to recover Oregon Coast coho salmon within 50 years, it will cost 15.17 to 101.88 million dollars per year. The cost is lower than the benefit, 321 million to 1.46 million dollars per year, estimated by Lewis et al (2019).
